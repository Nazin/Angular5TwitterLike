## Possible improvements

* Angular 7 to avoid technical debt
* SCSS - better integration with bootstrap (scss of bootstrap could be imported directly in the project and use of variables and functions would be possible)
* Prettier for some better code formatting
* I18n - Angular handles internationalization well, so it should be used in the project too
